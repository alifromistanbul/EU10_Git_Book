Getting books chosen just for you delivered to your door each month couldn't be easier!

1.  Just choose the length of your subscription and fill out the questions here and tell us as much as you can
about your book-related likes, dislikes, desires, hopes, and dreams!  Include a link to your Goodreads profile,
if you have one!

2.  We take that information and do our magical literary matchmaking and send you a book chosen just for you,
beautifully wrapped, with a special little literary treat!

3.  Write to us and let us know your thoughts about the pick and we will continually update your profile to refine
our choices for you!  AND if you already have the book we sent or don't think it's a good fit, no problem!
We will send you a replacement at no cost!
